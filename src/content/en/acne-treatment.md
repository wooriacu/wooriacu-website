# Acne Treatment: Addressing the Root Cause

## 1. Understanding Acne

Acne is not just a surface skin issue—it is closely linked to internal balance and lifestyle habits. Without addressing the underlying causes, acne may return even after treatment.

In Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM), acne causes are broadly classified as internal factors and external factors.

## 2. Constitutional Factors

Everyone has a unique constitution, so acne may appear differently in each person.

- **Those with excess heat**: Prone to inflammatory or pus-filled acne.

- **Those with weakness or cold tendencies**: Acne may become chronic, and scars or pigmentation may occur.

Adjusting diet and lifestyle according to your constitution is key to effective treatment and prevention.

## 3. Diet and Nutrition

Overeating, unbalanced meals, and consuming processed or highly spicy foods can increase sebum production and worsen inflammation. Nutritional deficiencies slow skin recovery, potentially leading to scarring and discoloration.

### Foods to Avoid:

- **Highly processed foods**: Instant noodles, packaged snacks, fast food
- **Excessively oily or fried foods**: French fries, fried meats, greasy snacks
- **Sugary foods and drinks**: Soda, candy, sweetened desserts
- **Artificial additives**: Food coloring, flavoring, preservatives
- **Excess alcohol or caffeinated beverages**
- **Highly spicy or stimulating foods**

A balanced diet with fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins is essential for acne prevention and overall skin health.

## 4. Seasonal and Environmental Factors

Weather changes, humidity, polluted air, and harsh skin care routines can all aggravate acne.

## 5. Stress and Fatigue

Stress, lack of sleep, and overwork disrupt the circulation of qi and blood, increasing facial heat and sebum production, which can trigger acne. Adequate rest and stress management are essential.

## 6. Medication, Infection, and External Damage

Overuse of antibiotics or steroids, bacterial or fungal infections, and repeated picking or irritation can all contribute to chronic acne.
